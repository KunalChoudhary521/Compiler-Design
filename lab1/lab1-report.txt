Special problems encountered:

1.  null was being treated as an identifier. We decided to create a different token
    for null, where KEY_NULL is the token.

2.  Integer overflow was not generating an explicit error. We wrote a small piece of code
    that checks whether the user given integer is within the bounds. If it is not, then
    yERROR() is called.
 
3.  A negative number is treated as 2 tokens, instead of 1. For example, -123 is treated as
    2 token, where "-" is one token and "123" is another token. This is done to allow for 
    easier parsing of mathematical expression when the parser is code in the future.
