Work Breakdown:
1	Kunal: 
	-	wrote ambiguous CFG in parser.y
	-	wrote test cases for parser in parser_tester.txt

2	David:
	-	

Challenges faced:
1	Converting the ambiguous CFG to unambiguous CFG (How? <explain process here>)
2	Differentiating between binary_op '-' from unary_op '-'
	-	We used %prec when defining the grammar of unary_op '-' to distinguish
		between binary_op '-' from unary_op '-'


Overall Approach taken:
1	Create test cases for the parser in parser_tester.txt
2	Copy the ambiguous CFG in parser.y
3	Check which tests fail
4	Convert ambiguous CFG to unambiguous

How your group verified the parser?:
1	We created test cases for the parser in parser_tester.txt
2	If a test passes or fails unintentionally, then modify the parser
3	Test parser again, repeat step#2

Anything interesting:
1	Bison does not automatically differentiate between binary_op '-' from unary_op '-'
