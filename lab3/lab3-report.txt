Breakdown of work:
1   Kunal - Implement AST (ast.c)
2           Implement Semantic Analysis (semantic.c)
3           Implement Symbol Table (symbol.c)
4           Write test cases to test AST and semantic analyzer

Approach to type/semantic checking:


Approach to AST structure:


Challenges faced:
-   Pre-order and post-order traversal in AST are distinctly different than in BSTs. In ASTs, each node can have a variable number of child-nodes. As a result, coding these traversals were more tedious to write.

Novelties/found anything interesting:
